# City Bikes

## Overview of Project
Based on the CSV file named *"201908-citibike-tripdata.csv"* from **"https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data"** , is important to analyze the number of users and the most busiest hours in order to provide the best service.

#### This project includes:
- Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format.
- Visualizations for the Trip Analysis.
- Story and Report for the Final Presentation.

### Purpose
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders in order to prioritize the busiest locations and hours.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week in order to determine the busiest and the best day to prioritize in mantainance.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week in order to implement best rates for the users and the company depending on the day and hours.

### Data Visualization
Please, refer to the [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Challenge_14_16318290341130/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "Tableau dashboard") in order to visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based findings
Subscribers that are male, are the ones that use bikes the most. The busiest hours are on Thursday between 5PM and 6PM. Early hours and late hours are the best in order to give mainteinance to the bikes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The principal challenge for this analysis is to take into consideration important data and information that will provide the expected results using Tableau.

## Results
- There are not many bikes rented for a 24 hour period.
- During the first hour there are more bike rentals.
- Thursday is the busiest day of the week.
- The peak hours are during 5PM and 6PM.
- It's important to consider the number of bikes in every location and the ones that are used the most, in order to schedule maintenance.
- There must be an analysis of prefered routes for the rentals in order to evaluate possible advertising.
